    * Questions are not comprehensive, nor are they necessarily truthful. This is based on interviewees sharing info on their own volition, so questions may change. 
  
  * Who is it for?
    
    * Students that would like to prepare for interviews, but are self-sufficient enough to find answers on their own. Not comprehensive, but great if used in conjunction with algorithm-based interview prep like FreeCodeCamp. 

* [Quora * Developer Questions](https://www.quora.com/-What-interview-questions-should-I-ask-a-junior-web-developer)

    * Less about technical aspect than the behavioral.
  
  * Who is it good for?
    
    * Potential junior devs may find these to be insightful since many employers seem to be looking for desire and willingness to learn rather than technical knowledge.
